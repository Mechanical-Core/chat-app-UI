# chat-app
Chat app user interface with SCSS and React

to run the app:
- make sure you are in the chat-app directory;
- open an integrated terminal in VSC and run `npm run dev`

The server will be run in development mode, so any save on the root project directory will initiate a refresh of the web page to display the saved change.
I recommend installing SASS live viewer to make style edits much faster and easier to save and see real time. (https://github.com/glenn2223/vscode-live-sass-compiler)
